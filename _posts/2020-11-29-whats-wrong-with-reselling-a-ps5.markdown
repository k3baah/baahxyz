# What's wrong with reselling a PS5?
*PS5's released on the 19th November, and people are reselling them. There seems to be more of a negative reaction than for other forms of reselling, and I'm wondering why.*

For an item to be resold it must be:

1. Limited
2. Desirable

Where this is true, there will be people coming to buy them in bulk and sell them at a profit. These people are resellers, price gougers, touters, whatever you call them.

The general public sentiment seems to be that this activity is morally bad (although unsurprisingly the people with the strongest opinions are from those who fail to buy things). I can see why. Resellers:

- Deny real fans the chance to enjoy it
- Get rewarded without adding value [1]
- Exist to extract [consumer surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus)

Some commonly resold categories of items are:

- Sneakers
- Cars
- Consoles
- Electronics
- Art
- Clothes
- Tickets

Some of these seem worse than others. For example, tickets resellers get their own name ("ticket touters") and there have been a few articles denouncing the PS5 'scalpers'.  On the other hand, there are people unashamedly making careers out of reselling clothes and sneakers, with platforms like Goat and StockX emerging to serve them. Luxury car dealerships often inflate the prices of their limited cars *themselves*, and this does not generate headlines. What's the difference?

### Market Size

The market for a pair of sneakers is limited to enthusiasts, so most other people don't really have an opinion. In my experience, the only ones that get upset about reselling sneakers are the older collectors that yearn for the good old days. A PS5 is mass market and incredibly popular (the PS4 sold [113m units](https://www.statista.com/statistics/651576/global-ps4-console-unit-sales/#:~:text=As%20of%20August%202020%2C%20cumulative,than%20in%20the%20first%20two.)), so you'll hear more negative opinions about reselling them just because they're more popular.

### Intrinsic or Extrinsic value?

With limited clothing and shoes and cars, their value actually comes from being limited. Customers want them precisely because they're not easy to get - either because it's satisfying to have things other people can't have, or because it's satisfying to be rewarded after multiple attempts. In that way, resellers actually *provide* value (although most people wouldn't see it like that).

There are other products, like the PS5, that are intrinsically valuable because of e.g. the gameplay, graphics, network, exclusives etc. People don't care if it's limited, they want its features. Here, resellers *extract* value by making people pay the maximum it's worth, which is a pain.

### Necessity or Luxury?

Flipping toilet paper during a pandemic would be frowned upon by almost everyone. Everyone needs it, so there's a lot of opportunity for straight up exploitation. Luxuries are optional, so someone missing out doesn't necessarily detract from their quality of life.

### Markup

Most people will have a negative reaction to something being marked up 100% with no added value. It just seems greedy. I guess a 10-20% markup is palatable to most people.

## Is it right?

Do I have a moral stance on this? Well, I'm a part of the group mentioned in [this article](https://metro.co.uk/2020/11/24/uk-scalper-group-has-more-ps5-consoles-to-sell-than-any-retailer-13645258/) [2], and I resold a few, so I clearly don't think it's wrong, although I see why someone would.

There's a distinction I didn't make previously - are resellers creating *artificial* scarcity by buying multiples? Or are they exploiting scarcity that already exists? It's likely a mixture of both, but I would agree that the former is reprehensible.

Even if you do think it's morally wrong, it doesn't matter if you don't buy one, because that just means more for the resellers [3]. In fact, the most ethical thing to do would be to get as many as you can and sell them for retail. The more people trying, the harder it is for resellers. But if you have the option, you're faced with the choice of 'should I double my money, or not?' and the answer to that seems obvious to me as long as nobody gets hurt. In fact, by charging the highest price, you're selling them to people that want them *most* [4].

[2] Articles seem to emphasise the use of bots, but most resellers bought them manually. It wasn't hard, and anyone could have done it with enough patience.

[3] I know someone that bought over 100. There are levels to this.

[4] This is kind of a reach. It could be that the people that want them the most are those who can't afford them.
