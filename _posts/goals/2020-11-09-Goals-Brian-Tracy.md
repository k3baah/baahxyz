# Goals! - Brian Tracy
*This post is under construction.* üõ†Ô∏è

In my opinion, these are the most useful parts of the book and the most relevant to me.

The rest of the book is adding context to each of these points by providing explanations, anecdotes and examples of how to set and achieve goals.

# The 5 Levels of Personality

The book:

- Explains the importance of values
- Explains importance of beliefs: which ones are useful and which aren't (self limiting are the worst)

Your goals should be guided by your personality. Your beliefs, expectations, attitude and actions all radiate from your **values.** Your **actions** are the deciding factor in whether you achieve your goals. You need to know the previous levels because they determine what actions you're willing to take.

## Example

Positive Values ‚Üí "I believe people are deserving of these values" ‚Üí "I'm a good person, and I expect good things to happen to me" ‚Üí "There's a lesson to be learned in adversity" ‚Üí Action

*This is the example given in the book. I'd probably give a different example, making it clear that you're trying to get to positive action.*
