### Practical Takeaways

- The ability to create explanatory knowledge sets us apart from other things in the universe.
- Knowledge is created, not 'read' or 'written' from nature.
- We use explanatory knowledge to solve problems.
- We make progress by solving problems (not avoiding them).
- Problems are unbounded and explanatory knowledge is unbounded → **Progress is unbounded**
- Within the laws of physics, solving a problem is simply a matter of seeking the right knowledge.
- Problems are inevitable.
- All problems are solvable, given the right knowledge.
- Look at the progress we have made and consider the knowledge required to get there: it is all out there for you to understand too.
- Consider the idea that all of your problems are solvable given the right knowledge. Getting what you want is a matter of solving the requisite problems to get there. You should run headfirst into these problems, not avoid them. ALL PROBLEMS ARE SOLVABLE.
- There is no limit to knowledge creation - you can contribute new ideas to the world, they have not all been taken.
- The problem of knowing what to do next is a universal one, (that's what moral philosophy is *really* about) so don't think it's just you
- Explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental - for example, you know how to drive a car fundamentally even if you don't know how a car works. Pick a useful level of abstraction and reason from there. Reasoning up from the level of the atoms might not be useful.
- Knowledge that is not reliably retrieved is not really being stored. That's a good case to be made for writing out this summary 😃
- We are universal explainers. Our universality is quite unprecedented, and there is no limit to the progress we can make.
- Remove arbitrary rules to make progress.
- We should strive to build universal systems e.g. in business, so we can deal with any problem.
- We can live a universal life - rather than looking for one thing (goal/outcome) that will make us permanently happy, we build systems and habits in our life that are fulfilling and naturally allow us to set and achieve goals
- Universal life: good nutrition, good fitness, no pain, no money problems, a clear conscience, a clear head, no huge involuntary commitments.
- We will always be scratching the surface - "we are always at the beginning of infinity", so don't think there's some absolute place you have to reach. Progress is good, but know when to stop (if ever - depends on what you want)
- There are things you won't solve, but this doesn't stop you from making progress.

### Summary

> In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations.

**TLDR**

1. Human progress comes from *good explanations.*
2. Good explanations get us closer to reality, which is desirable, because we can use them to transform the world and universe.
3. The ability to create good explanations makes humans important (if not the centre). Progress is unbounded except by the laws of physics, and can (and will) go on infinitely.
4. Knowledge creation is linked to genetic evolution.
5. Abstractions are real, and have an effect on physical reality. Explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental, not just the lowest one.
6. The jump to universality allows us to make unbounded progress.
7.  We haven't made much progress towards artificial (general) intelligence because it concerns creating a universal explainer.
8. Our unbounded knowledge growth depends on other types of infinity.

# Chapter 1 - The Reach of Explanations

We know how stars shine. This is puzzling, since they are billions of light years away, and because we have never been close to them. But we know that they are powered by the nuclear energy released by transmutation.

We know this, and things like it, because of scientific theory. For most of scientific history, we relied on a scientific doctrine named **empiricism.**

Empiricism is a theory that states that all knowledge is derived from sensory experience.

*Relevant People: John Locke, Hume
Opposing View: Rationalism*

Empiricism is not accurate because scientific theory is not derived from anything. That is to say, we do not 'read' them from nature with our senses, nor are they 'written' into us.

Instead, theories are bold guesses.

Experience is then useful in determining which guesses are better than others.

Empiricism was good because it criticised and rejected traditional approaches to knowledge:

- Holy books and ancient writings
- Human authorities such as priests and academics
- Lore, rules of thumb, hearsay

But there was something unresolved about empiricism: **how can knowledge of what has not been experienced be 'derived' from what has?**

Logical reasoning wouldn't help, because there'd always be a gap.

Conventional wisdom suggested that the key is *repetition.* If something happens a lot, then you can generalise into the future - one obtains reliable knowledge of the future from the past.

The typical example is: we expect the sun to rise tomorrow because it has done so consistently in the past.

This process was called 'inductive inference' or 'induction'. The related doctrine is **inductivism.**

Inductivism infers from observations of similar effects to similar causes, and generalises unrestrictedly—that is, by enumerative induction—to a universal law. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductivism#Inductivism))

*Relevant People: Francis Bacon*

Inductivists imagine that there is a 'principle of induction' that makes inductive inferences likely to be true. An example of this is 'The future will resemble the past'.

However, nobody has managed to formulate such a principle that is useful for obtaining scientific theories from experiences. There are two more criticisms of inductivism:

1. Inductivism explains how science obtains predictions about experiences. However, our knowledge does not come in this form. Science is about reality, not our experience of it. You will never predict how stars work (or what they are, or the laws of physics) from experience.
2. The future does not resemble the past. There are many examples where this is true (consider the creation of the atomic bomb).

> So much for inductivism. And since inductivism is false, empiricism must be as well. For if one cannot derive predictions from experience, one certainly cannot derive explanations.

Discovering an explanation is an act of creativity. You must first guess, and then you can conjecture, criticise and test. There are things you will never derive (or predict) from experience.

Empiricism aimed to liberate science from authority, but it created new authority in the form of:

- Sensory experience
- The fictitious process of induction

There is a misconception that knowledge needs authority to be valid. There is an idea that knowledge comes in the form of a 'justified' belief where 'justified' means designated as true by reference to some authority.

"How do we know?" == "By what authority do we claim?"

This turns the quest for truth into a quest for:

- Certainty (a feeling)
- Endorsement (social status)

This misconception is called **justificationism.**

Justificationism is the misconception that knowledge needs authority to be genuine or reliable. It is the prevailing view in current teaching of the philosophy of knowledge.

*Opposing view: Fallibilism*

The opposing view is **Fallibilism.** This is Deutsch's view.

Fallibilism ****is the view that there is no authoritative source of knowledge, nor a way of judging something as objectively true.

*Relevant people: Karl Popper, David Deutsch*

Fallibilists expect their best explanations to hold misconceptions as well as truth. This disposes them to try and change them for the better, which is not encouraged by the other systems explained previously.

For example, justificationism is about securing ideas against change.  Fallibilism is about changing your ideas.

We perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation - conjecture. This is the source of all our theories.

We have not yet answered our question. **How can we have an accurate knowledge about the reality that we have never experienced?**

It is useful to know this because knowledge is required to make progress.

For thousands of generations, basically no progress would happen in a person's lifetime. That changed during *the enlightenment,* that occurred in the 1400s. Science started to become successful. But why?

Well, there was a cultural shift towards rebellion against authority in regards to knowledge.

But it was not just this - the sustained, rapid growth of knowledge was supported by a tradition of criticism.

This tradition spawned **empiricism.**

One consequence of this was that scientific theory must be *testable.*

> Testability is now generally accepted as the defining characteristic of the scientific method. Popper called it the ‘criterion of demarcation’ between science and non-science.

Testability was not the decisive factor either. The reason that testability is not enough is that prediction is not, and cannot be, the purpose of science.

Scientists and philosophers in the 20th century thought that science is incapable of discovering anything about reality. Starting from empiricism, they said that science can't do more than predict outcomes of observations - it can't describe the reality that creates those outcomes. This is called **instrumentalism**, and denies what Deutsch refers to as explanations (the whole point of the chapter/book).

Instrumentalism is one of many ways of denying realism, the common-sense, and true, doctrine that the physical world really exists, and is accessible to rational inquiry.

The logical implication of instrumentalism is **relativism.**

Relativism is the doctrine that statements in a given field cannot be objectively true or false: at most they can be judged so relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard.

However:

Background knowledge == Knowledge that is familiar and uncontroversial.

A theory that only uses background knowledge is a rule of thumb.

Rules of thumb are not explanation-less predictions: they can always be explained.

> Instrumentalism, even aside from the philosophical enormity of reducing science to a collection of statements about human experiences, does not make sense in its own terms. For there is no such thing as a purely predictive, explanationless theory. One cannot make even the simplest prediction without invoking quite a sophisticated explanatory framework.

The requirement for experimental testing is that there are at least two viable theories about the issue, making conflicting predictions. The conflict would (hopefully) be resolved by the experiment.

Similarly, *conflicting ideas* are the occasion for all rational thought and inquiry.

A 'problem' is a situation where we experience conflicting ideas, whether in observation or purely theoretical. It is a problem when the way things are (according to our best explanation) is not the way they should be.

Solving a problem means creating an explanation that resolves the conflict.

> Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contradictions in reality, every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate.

We are still trying to figure out what changed to allow us to start making rapid progress after the enlightenment. So far, we have discussed the idea of testability and dispelled instrumentalism by arguing that there *are* objective truths which we can get nearer to using explanations.

However, testable, explanatory theories cannot have been the cause of the enlightenment, because these have been around for a long time. The example used is myth.

The problem with myths, even though they are testable and explanatory, is that they are easy to vary.

> Whenever a wide range of variant theories can account equally well for the phenomenon they are trying to explain, there is no reason to prefer one of them over the others, so advocating a particular one in preference to the others is irrational.

Explanations that are easy to vary are *bad explanations.* They can be changed to other bad explanations when new information disproves the original. That is to say, there is no logical reason for each part of the explanation.

However, a person can't make progress by just dropping bad explanations when they are refuted, they must also seek good explanations.

So the enlightenment was caused by **the search for good explanations,** which implies the other conditions mentioned. These were:

- Rebellion
- Critisicm
- Testability

> That is what makes good explanations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good explanation – hard to vary – that it even matters whether it is testable. Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not.

Rapid progress was caused by the search for **good explanations.** A good explanation is one that is **hard to vary.**

But still. How do we know so much about unfamiliar aspects of reality? We still haven't answered this.

Well, in essence, starting with creative conjecture, we then seek a good explanation.

We look for good explanations because it stops us from fooling ourselves.

A good explanation is one that is hard to vary.

 It is no longer yours to refute - the evidence of its truth are corroborated by other good explanations.

Its consequences are far reaching, perhaps further reaching than you originally intended (consider the idea of gravity).

This reach is intrinsic to the explanation - it is not an extrapolation or an assumption.

# Chapter 2 - Closer to Reality

The previous chapter explained why we want to get closer to reality and how our attempts to do so have evolved over time. Deutsch introduces the idea of a 'good explanation' which is the best mechanism we have right now for creating knowledge (that gets us closer to reality).

In this chapter Deutsch explains how we counter-intuitively get closer to reality by putting more physical barriers between us and it.

> I could have looked up at the night sky in the direction of that cluster, and there would have been nothing between it and my eye but a few grams of air – but I would have seen nothing at all. I could have interposed a telescope, and then I might have seen it. In the event, I was interposing a telescope, a camera, a photographic development laboratory, another camera (to make copies of the plates), a truck to bring the plates to my university, and a microscope ... I could see the cluster far better with all that equipment in the way.

The chapter continues to refute claims made by empiricists (although not overtly). The main refutation is that we cannot have 'pure' knowledge - it is always theory-laden. The point Deutsch is making is that progress requires the application of knowledge *before* making observations.

> Every additional layer of physical separation requires further levels of theory to relate the resulting perceptions to reality.

In the microscope example, all of its components required theory (explanations) to create them.

Our ability to recognise distant stars is incredible, as is the fact that we assemble materials from the earth to create them.

We design things on earth that allows us to *literally see* distant planets. Even though the tools we use involve pixels and silicon and mirrors etc. We create tools to correct misconceptions in our theories, thereby growing our knowledge.

> Explanatory theories tell us how to build and operate instruments in exactly the right way to work this miracle. Like conjuring tricks in reverse, such instruments fool our senses into seeing what is really there.

> Physically, all that has happened is that human beings, on Earth, have dug up raw materials such as iron ore and sand, and have rearranged them – still on Earth – into complex objects such as radio telescopes, computers and display screens, and now, instead of looking at the sky, they look at those objects. They are focusing their eyes on human artefacts that are close enough to touch. But their minds are focused on alien entities and processes, light years away.

Some parts of science are said not to be creative, for example toiling on a computer. However, every aspect of it is creative, in the sense that we had to create the computer in the first place. On the flip side, the computer itself is not creative.

> Now, can this creativity – and this fun – continue indefinitely?

# Chapter 3 - The Spark

This chapter argues that the knowledge is infinite, progress is unbounded, and that our capacity to produce explanatory knowledge is what makes us human.

Remember that the purpose of the book is to establish the importance of explanatory knowledge ("**good explanations**").

TLDR:

- Before science, humans relied on anthropocentrism - explanations about the world centred on humans
- Science dispelled this, but then installed the 'Principle of Mediocrity' ("There is nothing significant about humans")
- Another popular view was formed, namely the idea of *Spaceship Earth*. This is the idea that the earth is a life-support system for humans.
- Spaceship Earth cannot be true because the earth is not that hospitable without explanatory knowledge that gives us warmth, food, shelter etc. It gets cold and there are predators and extinction events. We engineer hospitability.
- The Principle of Mediocrity is wrong because we are the only creatures capable of creating explanatory knowledge (as opposed to only genetic knowledge).
- There is an argument (Richard Dawkins) that states that humans evolved based on selection pressures that were necessarily at the human size and scope e.g. you were not evolved to understand quantum mechanics (very small) or things moving at the speed of light (very fast). You can only understand the things immediately relevant to you, because that's what your brain was evolved to do. Hence, there is a limit to what we can understand, and we are nearing it. So far as we have understood counter-intuitive things already, we just got lucky. This is the *middle earth* idea, which invokes the principle of mediocrity by supposing that our brains are not any different to our eyes in regards to the magnitude (?) of their evolution.
- This is summarised as "Why should one adaptation our of the trillions ... have unlimited reach, when all others reach only inside ... the biosphere?"
- This argument is mistaken because explanatory knowledge can transform nature in all ways allowed by the laws of physics, and so is particularly important, because the reach of knowledge is the reach of humans.

**Transformations of the physical world are either:

- Impossible, because it is forbidden by the laws of nature
- Achievable given the right knowledge**

- The above is true because if you imagine a transformation not forbidden by laws of nature, and that we have the requisite knowledge to perform, the only way we would be unable to perform it would be due to some law of nature.

> The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes).

Is progress unbounded? Yes, if you have:

1. Access to matter
2. Energy
3. Evidence

Which we do, hypothetically, even in the most remote parts of the universe.

We will never run out of problems to solve. (Important: Problems are solvable)

- We thrive by solving problems
- We are limited only by the laws of physics

> It follows that humans, people and knowledge are not only objectively significant: they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature – the only ones whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding everything of fundamental importance.

# Chapter 4 - Creation

The main point of this chapter is that the process of evolution is linked to the process of knowledge creation.

Similarities:

- Genes and ideas are both replicators
- Knowledge and adaptations are hard to vary

Differences:

- Human knowledge is explanatory and has a large reach
- Genetic adaptations are not explanatory and their reach is limited by the environment they developed in

Because they are linked, false ideas about evolution have led to false ideas about knowledge creation.

- Creationism
- Lamarckism
- Argument from design

Which are wrong [because reasons].

Biological evolution does not optimise benefits to the species, to the individual or even to the gene, rather *the ability of the gene to spread through the population.* That is the gene's purpose. We can confer benefits as a side effect of this purpose.

Explanatory knowledge and biological adaptation are linked in that they both require variation (conjecture / mutations) and selection (criticism + experiment / natural selection).

Non-explanatory knowledge and biological adaptation seem to follow the same mechanism in the same way: just as adaptations can be made that are not necessarily improvements (because of the selfish gene idea expressed above), random variation in ideas (caused by mistranslation, misunderstanding) can spread e.g. because they rhyme, not because they're the best ideas.

Explanatory knowledge is mostly different: although its evolution comes from variation, a smaller % of this is random. Conjecture is constructed with a purpose.

> The most important source of variation in explanatory theories is creativity. For instance, when people are trying to understand an idea that they hear from others, they typically understand it to mean what makes most sense to them, or what they are most expecting to hear, or what they fear to hear, and so on.

In recent times, the argument from design is made to justify the 'fine-tuning' of the laws of physics. It is still wrong for the reasons Deutsch describes. 'Anthropic' theories are made to account for fine-tuning are bad explanations [for reasons].

# Chapter 5 - The Reality of Abstractions

Physics, for example, is both counterintuitive (e.g. gravity isn't a force) and complex (explaining the simplest things in terms of laws of physics e.g. atoms would be a huge task)

Luckily, this complexity gives rise to simplicity at higher levels (even though laws of physics are complex at the lowest level, we can still explain e.g. how a kettle works in terms of higher-level phenomena like its mass)

This property is called **emergence**

In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence))

A misconception about this idea comes in the form of **reductionism**

Reductionism is the idea that science must or should explain things by splitting them up into components, and emergent explanations of those components cannot be seen as fundamental.

Reductionism is a misconception because:

- Sometimes the high level is more useful
- Sometimes the lowest level is basically useless

To name two reasons.

Emergence is another *beginning of infinity* i.e. higher levels of explanation can be complete and fundamental in their own right, without relying (necessarily) on the lower levels.

Abstractions are the case where the emergence is the full story. (is this true?) / You cannot have the full story without the emergence

They are real! (there is much more to be said about them)

Abstractions are non-physical parts of reality that affect physical parts e.g. maths, knowledge, "laws of physics"

We can judge things objectively as right or wrong by the mechanism of good explanations.

Moral philosophy is concerned with "What should I do next?" in the context of what you want and how you think the world should be.

It is not just "How should I treat others?" although that is involved in the context of above.

# Chapter 6 - The Jump to Universality

The Jump to Universality is the tendency of gradually improving systems to undergo a large sudden increase in functionality, becoming universal in some domain.

An example of this is the evolution of written language, going from pictures (1:1 relationship from symbols to concepts, roughly) to an alphabet (26: ♾️ ).

Or the jump from numerals (roman, tally charts etc) to the number system we have now.

Universality is really important because it allows for unbounded innovation and progress.

Before the enlightenment, we stumbled across universality whilst looking for a solution to some parochial problem. Since the enlightenment, we have been looking for it actively, and made a lot of progress as a result.

Universality is achieved by removing arbitrary rules from the system.

Now it is embedded into institutions, we see universal systems like laws, morals etc. (roughly speaking - it's probably not there yet, but we're heading there)

Computers are perhaps the most important universal technology we created.

They can simulate the laws of physics, and can therefore simulate the human brain (topic of the next chapter)

Universal systems must be digital, because a universal system can only exist with robust error correction (I don't understand this well, but it's important)

DNA is universal.

*People* are universal.

To be specific, people are universal explainers, which is even one level of abstraction above universal computers. It is not yet understood how to make the jump - this is the topic of AGI (next chapter)

Because we are universal explainers, we are universal constructors.

As an aside - I wrote down:

- Computation
- Evolution
- Quantum Mechanics
- Knowledge

But i'm not sure why. I guess these are important instances of universality, and I intend to understand them all.

# Chapter 7 - Artificial Creativity

Short chapter:

It will be possible to explain qualia.

There are other attributes of the human mind that we have struggled with - namely, intelligence, consciousness, free will and meaning.

What we have been calling artificial intelligence is really just advanced computing.

Artificial (general) intelligence really concerns artificial creativity.

We haven't made any progress with artificial creativity because we don't understand how creativity works.

Once we do, artificial (general) intelligence will be a matter of programming a universal explainer, rather than programming a computer with a lot of parochial skills.

---

# Chapter 8 - A Window to Infinity

This is an introduction to the concept of infinity.

The possibility of the unlimited growth of knowledge in the future depends on other infinities.

In mathematics, infinity is studied via infinite sets.  The definition of an infinite set is one that some part of it has as many elements as the whole.

There have been different approaches to infinity in the past, and there are different opinions of it now. (I'm not going through them here)

There are a few interesting points about infinity - (this is not an exhaustive list of what's in the chapter)

- Some infinities are bigger than others (Georg Cantor's diagonalization argument)
- There are countable and uncountable infinities
- Every number is uniquely close to the beginning
- There are no typical values, no proportions, no probabilities

These ideas and more, are illustrated with the Infinite Hotel thought experiment

These ideas form the basis of a further criticism of the anthropomorphic explanations of the *fine-tuning problem* mentioned earlier. (I don't understand the problem well, nor the criticisms)

We shouldn't confuse abstract infinity with physical infinity

There are some mathematical things we can't solve

→ Undecidability

What is infinite and infinite *depends* on the laws of physics. In a universe with different laws of physics, like in the Infinite Hotel universe, different things are possible.

Mathematical proof is necessarily a physical process. This is in response to some arguments that state that we can have some knowledge about reality *a priori.* This goes against the conjecture+criticism model of knowledge proposed in the rest of the book.

# Chapter 9 - Optimism
