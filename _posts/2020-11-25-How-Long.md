> "How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?"
— Epictetus

Reading this stopped me in my tracks.

- Eventually you will decide to demand the best for yourself, so why not now?
- The best is possible.
- The best is in your control.

These could have been their own posts, but now they don’t have to be.
