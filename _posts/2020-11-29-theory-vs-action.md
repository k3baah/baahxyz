# Theory vs Action

We know intuitively that some skills can't be learned without action. You could read all the driving books in the world, but you'll never know how to drive until you practice. You can learn to drive without reading a single book.

But why? Theory is clearly important, but what does action give you that theory doesn't?

## Theory

What's theory good for? If you're trying to learn a skill, you need some basic understanding before you can start. I consider theory on four dimensions:

- Memorisation
- Principles and fundamentals
- Problem solving (the theoretical kind, like taking an exam)
- Wider context

To use the driving example, you need to:

- Memorise road signs
- Understand the rules - drive on the left, give way and overtake to the right [1]
- Sit a theory test
- Understand the law - e.g. insurance, tax, road safety

Without these you would struggle, even if you could manoeuvre a car like a professional. So don't get me wrong, theory is important. In school, we are taught that 'learning' is synonymous with **'learning theory'. But we lose out if there's no focus on implementation - on taking action.

## Action

Even if you understood the above perfectly, you'd be hopeless behind the wheel until you practiced. And you *could* learn how to drive a car without learning the theory. Why? There are some important distinctions, and understanding them can help us make progress generally.

### Emotion

Emotions play a critical part in learning and progress. When you learn to drive, you realise that it's important to manage fear and anger so you can avoid an accident. On the other hand, positive emotion motivates you to progress all the way to the end. You wouldn't learn that in a book.

### Sensory Information

Our senses let us shortcut the learning process. Rather than spending time figuring out how gears in a car work, we can just listen to the engine to decide when to change.

### Physical Training

A huge part of learning to drive is developing muscle memory from repeated movements. (Does anyone else forget that they were even driving?)

### Habit Formation

Similarly, when you start lessons, you realise that a big part of learning is just being consistent with your practice and making a habit of it.

### Decision Making

There is a distinction between learning to move a car and knowing what to do on the road.

### Improvisation

No book can cover every possible situation, so a big part of learning is improvisation. You learn to drive on quiet roads, but once you're on your own, you could end up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/comments/gqxvto/the_magic_roundabout_in_swindon_uk_is_very_crappy/), and you'd have to know what to do.

### Feedback Loops

When you are driving, you immediately know when you've made a bad decision. Your instructor tells you, or you get honked at.

You also get a lot of opportunities to practice situations repeatedly - for example, if you mess up at a roundabout, there's probably another one a few hundred metres away and you can try again. If you stall the car, you can turn it on and try again instantly.

### Do you like it?

It might be that after your first few lessons you decide you hate driving and you don't want to bother. You won't have a good idea about that until you've been behind the wheel.

## Why did you just explain all of that?

Great question. I want to make the point that you can't make progress without action. Knowing we should take action is obvious in some situations, but less so in others.

I'm currently figuring out what to do with my life, and I've recently gone through a shift in my thinking. Before, I spent a lot of time searching for principles and frameworks to make the best decision *in theory*. But there is too much uncertainty to know a priori what the best decision will be. Now, I plan to just try out as many things as possible. Theory is useful in deciding what to try, but the real progress is made in the action itself. [3]

## Appendix

1.  How is this different to memorisation? Well, learning the principles is different to memorisation in that you don't memorise each individual principle, they are just embedded into the system as a whole - you can't really have one without the other. Conversely, a road sign looks the way it does just because of convention. You could change it and it wouldn't affect the system of road signs.
2. This is why people drop out of uni - you make a Â£70,00 decision by vaguely  guessing what you'd like to do. You don't know if it's a good decision until three or four years later. By which time, you could have run 36 different 1-month experiments (internships, business ideas etc) and had a pretty good idea of what you like and don't like / what's feasible and infeasible. If there's one thing to take away it's this. You make progress through trial and error. The shorter the time between trial and error, the more progress you make. Successful people have gone through the most *iterations*, they haven't necessarily spent the most time.
3. The analogy doesn't map perfectly here because I'm initially talking about why action is useful to learn a particular skill, and then I talk about using action to figure out what skill to learn. It doesn't matter - action is important for problem solving in general.
