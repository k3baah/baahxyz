# The Universal Context

You read books and get advice but it's useless without context. Sometimes you will re-read a book and find something you glazed over the first time was actually really important. This is because you have additional context. You realise something like "This advice works extraordinarily well under these conditions but I can't apply it everywhere".

For example, in The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin, he mentions that you should never waste a good nights sleep - if you go to sleep with a problem unsolved, it will be solved the next day. This resonated with me because I have experienced it, but in the absence of experience it could have gone under the radar.

Also, there's a bunch of preliminary stuff that affects whether the advice is useful. For example, are you working on something purposeful? If so, the above advice will be useful. But it might be that you haven't encountered the idea that purposeful-ness is important - you might still be floundering, without clear goals, and lack the necessary context to internalise the advice.

*There are better examples I can use.*

The question is this:

**Does there exist a sort of 'universal context' that forms a foundation from which relevant and important advice (in a certain category of advice e.g. how to make money) delivers the full impact?**
